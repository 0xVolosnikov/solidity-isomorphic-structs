# solidity-isomorphic-structs

Tool for automatic generation of isomorphic structs in solidity. Here isomorphic structures are structures that fit into 256 bits and therefore can be placed both in memory and on the stack.

Using special types for structures generated by this tool allows to place them on the stack and avoid unnecessary use of memory.

**!!Work in progress!!**
